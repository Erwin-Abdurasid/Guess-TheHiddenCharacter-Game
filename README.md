## Software Description

This is a Console App developed using C# Programming Language.

## How It Works

1. When the user first fires up the app, it will show the title/logo of the app and 
prompt the user to enter his name. After it has the user's name, it will welcome the user.

2. Then, it will show the app's menu which are: Start, Instructions and Quit, while prompting the user
to choose from those as number from 1 to 3. When the user chooses number 1, it will start the game. First, it will show to the user 3
characters with each name and attributes. Then, the screen will change and will show only 1 character
with full-packed attributes and name existed as blank, while prompting the user to guess the name of the character based on the attributes.

3. When the user guesses wrong, his 3 game life will reduce, otherwise his score/points will increase by one. And the user
can play the game so long as he wants.

4. Back to menu, when the user chooses number 2, it will show to the user the instructions for playing the app.
And if the user chooses number 3, the app will thank the user and exit gracefully.
