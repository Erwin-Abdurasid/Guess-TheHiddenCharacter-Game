## Software Description

This is a console app developed using the C# programming language.

## How It Works

1. When the user first fires up the app, it will show the title or logo of the app and
prompt the user to enter his name. After it has the user's name, it will welcome the user.

2. Then, it will show the app's menu, which includes Start, Instructions, and Quit, while prompting the user to choose	
from those as numbers from 1 to 3. When the user chooses number 1, it will start the game. First, it will show the user
three characters for each name and attribute. Then, the screen will change and will show only 1 character with full-packed
attributes and the name existing as blank, while prompting the user to guess the name of the character based on the attributes.

3. When the user guesses wrong, his 3-game life will reduce; otherwise, his score or points will increase by one. And the
user can play the game as long as he wants.

4. Back to the menu, when the user chooses number 2, it will show the user the instructions for playing the app. If the user
chooses number 3, the app will thank the user and exit gracefully.
